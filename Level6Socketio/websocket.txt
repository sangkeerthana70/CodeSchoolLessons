These days modern browsers have web sockets which allow us to make connection
with each of our clients to the server. Over this connection we can send and receive data
from the server in real time.

For this we need to install the socket.io

1-Install express
2-require http module and create a server which will dispatch request to the express.
3-require socket.io module--save which adds to the package.json which allows it to use the http server to listen for requests
4=Note that express ans socket.io are using the same http server.
5-listen for connection event from the client inside the socket.io and when a client connects  we will log to the 
6-console that a client has connected.
7-then we serve our index.html file using the sendFile function through our express.
8-make the server listen on PORT-8080
9-create an html file and include the socket.io library which gets loaded in our clients browsers.
10- now connect to our socket.io server.
11- in our app.js(server) we are now including the client.emit messges event that sends back 
a message "Hello: World" inside of an object back to our client which is also the browser.
12-After this inside of our browser (index.html) we are going to listen to our messages
event and when it gets called we call alert function and have it alert with the data
that it received looking up the hello property in the server(app.js) with the value of
"Hello".
13- now we run our app.js it starts or node serverwhich connects to the localhost 
8080 browser through socket.io and send a message back into our browser and an alert 
window pops up. Also we get a log message saying the Client connected.
