/* Client socket.io Setup.
1-In our html file, load the socket.io.js script and connect to the socket.io server.
This will include the socket.io library which will be loaded in our clients browsers*/
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
2-Load the socket.io.js script. The socket.io.js path you should use is 
'/socket.io/socket.io.js'. Express knows to serve the socket.io client js for this path.
This following line will connect to the socket.io server*/
3-Using the global io object that's now available for us, connect to the socket.io 
server at http://localhost:8080.*/
var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');//// use the socket.io server to connect to localhost:8080 here

/*Challenge 6.4
Listening For Questions 
1-In our client below, listen for 'question' events from the server and call the 
insertQuestion function whenever the event fires.
2-First, listen for 'question' events from the server
3-Now, have the event callback function call the insertQuestion function. The 
insertQuestion function is already created for you, and it's placed in its own file.
It expects exactly one argument - the question.

<script>
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  // Insert code here
  server.on('question', function(question) {//Step-2listen for 'question' events from the server.
    insertQuestion(question);//Step-3 above.
});        
</script>
//=============================================================================================
/* Challenge-6.8 
Answering Question Client 
Now on the client, listen for the 'answer' event and then add the appropriate data
to the DOM.
Task-1/2 Listen for the 'answer' event off of the server.
Task-2/2 Call the answerQuestion function, passing in both the question and the answer
that was broadcast from the server*/

<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

<script>
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  server.on('question', function(question) {
    insertQuestion(question);
  });
  
  server.on('answer', function(question, answer){//Task-1/2
    answerQuestion(question, answer);//Task 2/2

  });
   
  //Don't worry about these methods, just assume 
  //they insert the correct html into the DOM
  // var insertQuestion = function(question) {
  // }

  // var answerQuestion = function(question, answer) {
  // }
